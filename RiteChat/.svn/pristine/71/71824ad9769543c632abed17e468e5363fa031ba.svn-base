atthew William Matthies was born on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 2004 at 5:21 p.m. and weighed 6lbs 7 0z.  The day after his birth we were advised he had a slight heart murmur that was most likely innocent and not a concern.

After two pediatric visits and a murmur that “supposedly” went away and came back his pediatrician decided we should take Matthew to a cardiologist to be further evaluated.
On February 4, 2005 we visited a well know cardiologist in central New Jersey.  On that day our whole world came crashing down.  After Matthew was examined we were told by the doctor that he was a very sick baby and we must get him to Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia that same day.  Needless to say, we were in shock and kept asking “what does Matthew have” and all the doctor could say was he was a very sick little boy and nothing else.

With that we ran home, gathered some things together and immediately took him to CHOP.  When we arrived at the hospital he was given a follow up ECHO, EKG, some blood tests and they decided to keep him over the weekend.  A cardiac catheterization was scheduled for Monday, February 7, 2005 to determine the extent of the problem.
After his catheterization, we were give the very grim news that Matthew had serious Aortic and Pulmonary Stenosis and that he would require heart bypass surgery right away to correct the problem.  We were also told he had the same Congenital Heart Defect as children with William Syndrome.  After many visits and tests by genetic doctors they ruled out Williams Syndrome, but we were advised Matthew had the same CHD characteristics as Williams Syndrome children.

Matthew had his bypass surgery on February 9, 2005.  It was ruled a success based on what they saw before surgery and after surgery and they were able to do more for him than originally though.  He healed so well that he was released right from ICU on February 13, 2005.

Matthew William is a fighter and he recovered fast.  When he was born he showed no signs of having a CHD.  He was eating, growing and seemed very healthy.
At 14-months old, while still growing and doing well, he was sent back to CHOP in Philly to have another catheterization.  During this procedure they took many pictures and tests. They were able to see that the aortic stenosis surgical site was doing very well and it was open and looked great. They did however need to perform some balloon dilation on the right pulmonary arteries. The goal of this was to open up the arteries so as to relieve some excess pressure in his heart. Again, he did excellent in surgery and was released the next day.

After some follow up ECHOS and EKGS it was determined by Matthew’s new Cardiologist and CHOP doctors that he should return to CHOP once again but this time to have the left pulmonary arteries dilated.
